## GutHib Joke Template
So basically I saw guthib.com and thought that it would be neat if after some time it gave you the real github link. Then I thought it would be neat if others could use it too. So I created [this](https://guthib.dacoconutnut.repl.co/). 

In the beginning of the index.html file there are settings in the form of JS variables with comments, you'll figure it out. 
(after you chose the theme you like, you can delete the css file of the theme you don't use and delete README.md)
